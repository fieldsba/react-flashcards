# Title
React Flashcards

# Description
React Flashcards is an app built using ReactJS and the Open Trivia Database API (https://opentdb.com/api_config.php). The app allows the user to generate a chosen number of flashcards with questions and answer choices from 24 different categories. Like with any flashcards, the questions and answer choices are shown on the front of the card, and the correct answer is shown on the back of the card, which is revealed by clicking. I am a huge trivia nerd and Jeopardy fan and had a ton of fun creating this project!

# Instructions for Use
After cloning the repository, simply run the command 'npm start' from the project directory! :)
